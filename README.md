## Agent for Raven’s Problem

Develop an agent to solve a set of problems inspired by the Raven’s Progressive Matrices test of intelligence by using both **verbal** and **visual** approach. The agent developed based on training dataset has to be general enough to also solve the problems in test datasets.


#### Verbal Approach

* Verbal representation to read in the problem since it is an easier and more straightforward way to read in the objects and attributes for each figure. After reading in the objects and corresponding attributes, the agent firstly determines the relationship between Fig. A and Fig. B and uses this relationship to get the solution from Fig. C.

#### Visual Approach

* For each problem, including 7 figures for problem description and 8 figures for candidate solutions. After reading in the 7 figures about problem description, the agent solves the problems from different problem set by using different solver functions.

### Running the Tests
